# Six-ServoRobotLegJoints

# Task 1: Designing the Robot's Leg Joints Using 6 Motors

# Description

This task focuses on designing and implementing the leg joints of the robot using six servo motors. The objective is to ensure smooth and efficient movement.

* The process includes:

1. Joint Configuration: Determining the optimal arrangement of the six motors to achieve the desired range of motion and stability.
   
2. Mechanical Design: Creating 3D models of the joints and connecting elements to ensure robustness and lightweight construction.


* The following image illustrates the design and configuration of the robot's leg joints with the six servo motors:
